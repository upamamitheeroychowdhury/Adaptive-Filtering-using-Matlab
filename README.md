This project evaluates a broad class of adaptive filtering algorithms—LMS, NLMS, Leaky
LMS, Block LMS, Sign-error, Sign-data, Sign-sign LMS, VS-LMS, and GAL—under diverse
stationary and nonstationary noise conditions. Using speech signals, AR(1) colored noise, sinusoidal interference, impulsive disturbances, and time-varying processes, we examine each
algorithm’s convergence, tracking ability, steady-state behavior, misadjustment, and sensitivity
to eigenvalue structure. The study provides a unified experimental comparison linking classical
theory to modern adaptive filtering challenges.
